    <h1> About us </h1>
    <p>Furever is an app made with the problem of burned out lonely students or young people in mind. The solution is a dog-walking app where you get points for how far you walk the dog. This is further incentivized through the ability to use those points on discounts from different businesses in Oslo we are partnered with. We feel the opportunity for students to be able to interact with animals while at the same time getting some exercise is an easy and excellent way to combat student loneliness and burnout.
    <br><br>
    It's important to note that this idea is made with students in mind but anyone can use it. It's not just students who get burned out or are lonely and can use animal companionship.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>
    First you download our app at the bottom of our page - or through the google play store / apple store. Then you create a profile and you're halfway there. We love our dogs and want to keep them as safe as possible, so you will be properly vetted by our coworkers at the shelters to make sure nothing bad will happen to the animals. After everything is in order your profile will get upgraded to dog-walker. This is a one time thing the first time you visit a shelter. But every time you visit you will need to leave your id for safety measures. Then you can walk a dog, it's as easy as that. For future walks you can easily reserve a dog through the app so the whole process is sped up significantly!

    <p>
    Being <b>burned out</b> as well as <b>loneliness</b> are very real problems in todays society. The younger generation nowadays has a much better shot at getting a decent education, however with so many people getting educated it means the competition to be the best is very tough. Everyone wants to get their dream jobs so students work harder and harder and <b>burn themselves out</b>, they often neglect their social lives to focus more on school.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="solution">
    <h1>Our goals</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    This is where we swoop in. Our solution is a true and tested way to take back control over your life. With our app people can visit local shelters where our workers will help them choose a dog or several dogs to walk. When you're walking our dogs you wont even notice the fact that you are exercising at the same time. Your mind can be focused on something else rather than your stressful day to day lives. We are a free service so you are not only helping yourself, but also the animals at our shelters!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Why shelters?</h1>
    <br>
    <img class="dogwalking" src="dogwalking.jpg" alt="picture of a woman walking a dog">
         <!-- source: https://www.rover.com/blog/preparing-dog-for-dog-walker/  -->
    <p>
    We wanted our app to not only help people but animals as well. The animals at these shelters have been abandoned and also need to be social. Our app is the first step on the way for people to be able to get their stressful daily lives a bit under control by taking a nice walk with an animal in sore need of love and affection.

    In addition to all of this you gain points that you can use on discounts. More info below!
