	<p tabindex="0">The younger generation nowadays has a much better shot at getting a decent education, however this means the competition to be the best is very tough.
	</p>
	<p tabindex="0">
    According to <a href="https://www.uio.no/for-ansatte/arbeidsstotte/sta/undersokelser/shot/rapportene/shot-2018-studentenes-helse-og-trivselsundersokelse.pdf" target="_blank" tabindex="0"><b>SHoT 2018 - Research</b></a>, 1 out of 3 students say that they will do anything not to disappoint the people in their lives, therefore <b>burning themselves out</b>. The same research shows that 3 out of 10 students say they are <b>lonely</b> and 45% of students say they are <b>tired</b> and that they have <b>little energy</b>.
	</p>
	<p tabindex="0">
    The research also shows that 42% of students report mental disorders, 13% of these say that they are moderate, 18% say that they are serious and 11% say that they are serious and that they have a lot of issues.
    So being burned out as well as loneliness are very real problems in today’s society.
    </p>
    <a id="solution"></a>
    <h1 tabindex="0">The solution</h1>
    <p tabindex="0">
    FURever is an app made with these problems in mind. The solution is a dog-walking app where you get points for how far you walk the dog.
    </p>
	<p tabindex="0">
    According to <a href="http://www.center4research.org/benefits-pets-human-health/" target="_blank" tabindex="0"><b>an article from Center4Research</b></a>:
    “The social support a pet provides can make a person feel more relaxed and decrease stress. The social support provided by a pet might also encourage more social interactions with people, reducing feelings of isolation or loneliness.” 
	</p>
	<p tabindex="0">
    The app is further incentivized through the ability to use those points on discounts from different businesses in Oslo we are partnered with.
    </p>
    <p tabindex="0">
    We wanted our app to not only help people but animals as well. With our app people can visit local shelters where our workers will help them choose a dog or several dogs to walk. The animals at these shelters have been abandoned and also need to be social. When you're walking our dogs you won't even notice the fact that you are exercising at the same time. Your mind can be focused on something else rather than your stressful day to day life. We are a free service so you are not only helping yourself, but also the animals at our shelters!
	</p>
	<p tabindex="0">
    It's important to note that this idea is made with students in mind but anyone can use it. It's not just students who get burned out or are lonely and can use animal companionship.
    People are then able to get their stressful daily lives a bit under control by taking a nice walk with an animal who is also sorely in need of love and affection.

        </p>
    <p tabindex="0">
    First you download our app at the bottom of our page - or through the Google Play Store / Apple App Store. Then you create a profile and you're halfway there. We love our dogs and want to keep them as safe as possible, so you will need to be properly vetted by our coworkers at the shelters to make sure nothing bad will happen to the animals. 
	</p>
	<p tabindex="0">	
	After everything is in order your profile will get upgraded to dog-walker. This is a one time thing the first time you visit a shelter. But every time you visit you will need to leave your ID as an insurance. Then you can take a dog for a walk, it's as easy as that. For future walks you can easily reserve a dog through the app so the whole process is sped up significantly!
