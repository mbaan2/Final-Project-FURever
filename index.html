    <h1> Who are we? </h1>
    <p>Furever is an app made with the problem of burned out lonely students or young people in mind. The solution is a dog-walking app where you get points for how far you walk the dog. This is further incentivized through the ability to use those points on discounts from different businesses in Oslo we are partnered with. We feel the opportunity for students to be able to interact with animals while at the same time getting some exercise is an easy and excellent way to combat student loneliness and burnout.
    <br><br>
    It's important to note that this idea is made with students in mind but anyone can use it. It's not just students who get burned out or are lonely and can use animal companionship.

    <p>
    Being burned out as well as loneliness are very real problems in todays society. The younger generation has the benefit of easily being able to get an education, however with so many people getting educated it means the competition to be the best is very tough. Everyone wants to get their dream jobs so students work harder and harder and burn themselves out, they often neglect their social lives to focus more on school.

    <h1>What can be done?</h1>

    <p>
    What can be done about this problem? Combating depression and loneliness is a tricky thing. You might think you dont have a lot of options but our solution is a true and tested way to take back control over your life, while at the same time giving back to the local dog shelters around Oslo.
    <br>
    <br>
    With our app people can check out their local shelters we are partnered with. They can decide on a location and our workers there will help them choose a dog or several dogs to walk. When you're walking our dogs you wont even notice the fact that you are exercising at the same time. Your mind can be on something else than your stressful day to day lives for a little while. We are a free service that not only helps yourself but also the animals at our shelters!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h1>Why shelters?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>

         <!-- source: https://www.rover.com/blog/preparing-dog-for-dog-walker/  -->
    We wanted this product to help as many disadvantaged people or animals as possible, so we decided to partner with an animal shelter in the center of Oslo. These animals have been abandoned and are also in need of social interaction. Our app is the first step on the way for people to be able to get their stressful daily lives a bit under control by taking a nice walk with an animal in sore need of love and affection.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to all of this you gain points that you can use on discounts. More info below!

    <br>
    <img class="discountsimg" src="app_rewards.png">
    <p>As you can see we have a plethora of options for you to choose between. You can get a free coffee before your early morning class, you can get candy for the sweet tooth in you and your dog, you can get a free hotdog to go while waiting for the tram, theres a free entrance to a museum for you museum enthusiasts, you can get a 2 for 1 deal at your local bowling alley and a free popcorn menu for you movie fanatics!
    <br>
    <br>
    We know young people can have problems with their personal economies so for us this is a vital part of our app to further help relieve stress and build some positive reinforcement for using our app.
    </p>
    <img class="discountsimg" src="app_donewalking.png">
    <p>But how will you get these rewards you say? Look no further than right above you my friend. You will get points in the app depending on how long and how far you have walked the dog for. You can level up in the app to compare yourself with friends that you can add on our app. 
    <br>
    <br>
    So our solution to the problem of loneliness and being burned out has a threefold solution! Not only do you get exercise that does not feel like you're actually working out, you get animal companionship with the opportunity to cuddle some awesome dogs as well as a way for young people to have more options when it comes to saving money.
